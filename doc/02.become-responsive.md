Become Responsive
--------------------

Gridle includes all you need to generate a **fully customizable, responsive grid system**.
The principle is a piece of cake. Gridle provides you with a mixin which creates (or registers) "states". States are Gridle's naming convention that helps you abstract media queries that are sometimes hard work. Here's how to use states:


### Register a State

To register a state, Gridle provides a simple and unique mixin:

```fn
@include gridle_register_state ( name , {settings} );
```

```scss
/**
* States with sizes :
*/
@include gridle_register_state( mobile , (
	max-width : 400px
) ):
@include gridle_register_state( tablet, (
	min-width : 401px,
	max-width : 767px,
	gutter-width : 30px 	// change the gutters for this state
) );

/**
 * States without classes generation :
 * Useful when you need a state that cover either the mobile
 * and the tablet for example...
 */
@include gridle_register_state( moblet , (
	min-width : 767px,
	classes : false		// the gridle_generate_class will not generate classes for this state
) ); 

/**
* State with media query :
*/
@include gridle_register_state( iphone-landscape , (
	query : "only screen and (max-device-width: ..."
) );
```

> The state can have all the settings available in gridle. If not set, a settings will take the default one defined in your gridle_setup.


### Using States

When you have registered you states, the **@include gridle_generate_classes()** mixin will generate additional classes to be used in your HTML. Here's a usage example with classes and mixins:

#### Classes

```markup
<div class="container">
	<div class="grid-3 grid-tablet-6 grid-mobile-12">
		3 columns, 6 on tablet, 12 on mobile
	</div>
	<div class="grid-12 hide-mobile">
		12 columns but I'm hided on mobile 
	</div>
</div>
```

#### Mixins

```scss
/**
* Using mixins :
*/
#content {
	@include gridle( 8 );
	@include gridle( 12 , mobile );
}
#sidebar {
	@include gridle( 4 );
	@include gridle_hide( mobile );
}
```

> Register state has to be done **before** generating classes (cf. Generate Classes Mixin)


### Register custom classes

Gridle allows you to generate custom classes that will be available for each of your states. Here's an exemple

```fn
@include gridle_generate_custom_class( {pattern} )
```

```scss
// the pattern is a list element or sass
@include gridle_generate_custom_class( ( 'center', '-', '%state' ) ) {
	text-align : center;
}
```

This will generate the following classes if you have registered the states (mobile, tablet, coco)

```fn
.center
.center-mobile
.center-tablet
.center-coco
```

> Be careful, for your separators like "-", use only the -, --, _, __ or the %- witch is the token for the option $gridle-class-separator
