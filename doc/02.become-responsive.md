Become Responsive
--------------------

Gridle includes all you need to generate a **fully customizable, responsive grid system**.
The principle is a piece of cake. Gridle provides you with a mixin which creates (or registers) "states". States are Gridle's naming convention that helps you abstract media queries that are sometimes hard work. Here's how to use states:


### Register a State

To register a state, Gridle provides a simple and unique mixin:

```fn
@include gridle_register_state ( name , {min-width} , {max-width} , {generate-classes} : true);
@include gridle_register_state ( name , query (without @media) , {generate-classes} : true  );
```

```scss
/**
* States with sizes :
*/
@include gridle_register_state( "mobile" , null , 400px ); // null mean no min width
@include gridle_register_state( "tablet" , 401px , 767px );

/**
 * States without classes generation :
 * Useful when you need a state that cover either the mobile
 * and the tablet for example...
 */
@include gridle_register_state( "moblet" , null , 767px , false ); // for use in mixins only (no classes)

/**
* State with media query :
*/
@include gridle_register_state(  "iphone-landscape"  ,  "only screen and (max-device-width: ..."  );
```

> Some special state called **retina**, **print**, etc.. are pre-built. See <a href="#useful-states-classes">Useful States Classes</a> chapter


### Using States

When you have registered you states, the **@include gridle_generate_classes()** mixin will generate additional classes to be used in your HTML. Here's a usage example with classes and mixins:

#### Classes

```markup
<div class="container">
	<div class="grid-3 grid-tablet-6 grid-mobile-12">
		3 columns, 6 on tablet, 12 on mobile
	</div>
	<div class="grid-12 hide-mobile">
		12 columns but I'm hided on mobile 
	</div>
</div>
```

#### Mixins

```scss
/**
* Using mixins :
*/
#content {
	@include gridle( 8 );
	@include gridle( 12 , "mobile" );
}
#sidebar {
	@include gridle( 4 );
	@include gridle_hide( "mobile" );
}
```

> Register state has to be done **before** generating classes (cf. <a href="#mixin-generate-classes">Generate Classes Mixin</a>)
	
> You can define a maximum of 15 states. This limitation is due to SASS limited capabilities for handling variables names. But anyway... No kidding... **15 is PLENTY**.


### Useful States Classes

Some useful states are pre defined like "**retina**", "**landscape**", etc... You can use them directly in the gridle_state mixin but... in order to generate the corresponding classes (ex : **grid-retina-12**, **hide-print**, etc...) when you make the @include gridle_generate_classes();, you have to set witch one you want like so :

```scss
/**
* Default value :
* By default, the retina and print state are generated
*/
$gridle-generate-useful-states-classes  :  ( "retina" , "print" );

/**
* All the possible useful states :
*/
$gridle-generate-useful-states-classes  :  ( "retina" , "landscape" , "portrait" , "print" , "tv" );
```
